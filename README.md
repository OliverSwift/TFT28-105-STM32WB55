# DM-TFT28-105 on STM32WB55

This little project is about using a TFT touch screen on Nucleo board and specifically a STM32WB55 based one.
Original codes and libraries have been drastically optimized to make this DisplayModule shield really usable.

What it provides:

  * New DmTftLibrary much faster with new font and functions
  * ANCS (iPhone notification) demo
  * ANP (Android notification) demo (*WIP*)
