# DM-TFT28-105 on STM32WB55

This little project is about using a TFT touch screen on Nucleo board and specifically a STM32WB55 based one.
Original codes and libraries have been drastically optimized to make this DisplayModule shield really usable.

While the source code is here, the link to the whole project documentation is: [TFT28-105 on STM32WB55](https://debon.org/TFT)
